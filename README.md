### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# whoami

I am a software developer working at Evolution Gaming in the Video Operations department. Mostly I do backend work in Erlang and Python. In my free time I like to work on projects in Clojure, and exploring design of functional programming languages. I have experience working with automated testing, computer vision, as well as serverless and cloud services like Heroku and AWS.
