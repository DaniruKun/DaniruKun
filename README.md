### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# whoami

I am a software developer focused on backend development, and learning XR and 3D!
In my day job I mostly work with Ruby and Elixir, and lisps in my free time.
Love exploring design of programming languages. I have experience working with automated testing, computer vision, media processing, web development, as well as serverless and cloud services like Heroku and AWS.
