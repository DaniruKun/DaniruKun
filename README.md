I am a software developer focused on backend development, and learning XR and 3D!
My day job is working at Streamelements, to help creators turn their passion into a career.
Love exploring design of programming languages. I have experience working with automated testing, computer vision, media processing, web development, as well as serverless and cloud services like Heroku and AWS.
