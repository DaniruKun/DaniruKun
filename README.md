### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# whoami

I am a software developer focused on backend development. Mostly I do work in Elixir and Ruby. In my free time I like to work on projects in Clojure, Lisp and exploring design of functional programming languages. I have experience working with automated testing, computer vision, media processing, web development, as well as serverless and cloud services like Heroku and AWS.
